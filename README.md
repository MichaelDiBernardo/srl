A clone of the roguelike [Sil](http://www.amirrorclear.net/flowers/game/sil/) that I attempted to write in Go in 2017. The idea is that it would have multiple clients (terminal, tiles, kinda like DCSS was at the time.) It's kind of a mess, but it was fun.

In the end, Angband variants ended up getting there faster than me because of gwarl and [angband.live](https://angband.live/), which is a thing of beauty.
