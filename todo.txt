NEXT:
- Level generation. 
    - Monster generation
    - Item generation
    - Map generation
- Stairs
 
Then:
- Monsters drop loot
- Monsters have tracking / movement+attacking AI. 
- Add stairs / progression.
- Add a basic "you got to level 5 you win"
- Egos (?), artefacts.
- Turncounting, speed
- Consumables can have duration effects.

Stuff:
- Consumables stack in inventories.
- XP spending on skills
- user-level configs for
    - keymaps
    - morgues
    - etc
- Monster AI

HAX:
- items aren't really using gameobj? They never get placed on a tile, just in an inventory in a tile. They could probably just be their own thing, and make *obj into *actor???
- Actor would have everything it has now
- Item would have Game, Level, (no tile), only have item traits, actor would only have actor traits
- OK, different idea -- maybe "placed on a map" is just merged into Mover, and you always go through Mover to get the tile. Then move Pos and all that crap over to Mover.
