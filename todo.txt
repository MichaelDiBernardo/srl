NEXT:
- LOS
- Player can only see in LOS
 
Then:
- Monsters have AI that:
    - Randomly wanders when player isn't in LOS
    - Chases and attacks when player in LOS
- Turncounting, speed
- Stairs
- Monsters drop loot
- Add stairs / progression.
- Add a basic "you got to level 5 you win"
- Egos (?), artefacts.
- Consumables can have duration effects.

Stuff:
- Consumables stack in inventories.
- Monster pack starting formation and proper pack placement.
- XP spending on skills
- user-level configs for
    - keymaps
    - morgues
    - etc
- Monster & Pack AI
- Room variations ("vaults")
- Room decorations

HAX:
- items aren't really using gameobj? They never get placed on a tile, just in an inventory in a tile. They could probably just be their own thing, and make *obj into *actor???
- Actor would have everything it has now
- Item would have Game, Level, (no tile), only have item traits, actor would only have actor traits
- OK, different idea -- maybe "placed on a map" is just merged into Mover, and you always go through Mover to get the tile. Then move Pos and all that crap over to Mover.
