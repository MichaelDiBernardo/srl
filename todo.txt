NEXT:
 - test death mode change
 - test body accumulator methods
 - test mores
 - do crits
 - test hit()
 
Then:
- Basic consumables.
    - Consumables stack in inventories.
    - You can use items.
- Level generation. 
    - Monster generation
    - Item generation
    - Map generation
- Monsters drop loot
- Monsters have tracking / movement+attacking AI. 
- Add stairs / progression.
- Add a basic "you got to level 5 you win"

Stuff:
- Equipment
    x inventory on ground and for actors
    x Picking up off ground (just the top)
    x showing what's in inventory
    s pickup up off ground (select what you want)
        x pick from menu
        x we really need commands to also be structs. keymaps be damned.
    x Inv has capacity
    x Write tests for this stuff ^
    x wielding or wearing what's in inventory
        x Weapons need a way to:
            x Describe their weight, damage dice, tohit.
            x Identify what equipment slot they should go in
            x Items need a trait "Equip"
    x hit with weapons
    x protect with armor
- XP spending on skills
- user-level configs for
    - keymaps
    - morgues
    - etc
- Monster AI

HAX:
- items aren't really using gameobj? They never get placed on a tile, just in an inventory in a tile. They could probably just be their own thing, and make *obj into *actor???
- Actor would have everything it has now
- Item would have Game, Level, (no tile), only have item traits, actor would only have actor traits
- OK, different idea -- maybe "placed on a map" is just merged into Mover, and you always go through Mover to get the tile. Then move Pos and all that crap over to Mover.
