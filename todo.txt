- Screens
- Very basic mechanics:
    - Stats
    - Skills derived from stats
    - Fighting weaponless
- Equipment
    - Player can wield, monster cannot (too complicated)
- Viewport over larger levels
- HUD
- repositories
- user-level configs for
    - keymaps
    - morgues
    - etc
- Map generation 
- Monster AI

CONSOLE STUFF:
- break out into modules
- Make a renderer or display interface that we can inject for tests, and is basically just termbox ( :( )
- Put all this stuff in a screen even if there's only one.
- then panels for:
33 wide x 21 tall
4 spaces between map and hud
