        - Ability to affect transitions on AI. (i.e. if a thief steals
          something, it should flee and not stop until it's dead)
    - Monsters need:
        - Collection of abilities with their probability of using it
        - Do angband-ish thing? One in X chance of using an ability, then
          %chance of each. If no ability available, then move/attack as normal.
