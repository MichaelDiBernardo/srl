- Very basic mechanics:
    - Stats:
        - single interface(s) that give accessors to stats and skills
          (Sheet???) and implementations for monsters and player
    - Fighting weaponless
        - Could start as single Fighter impl for both monsters and player, and
          then specialize from there when player equipment is implemented.
- Equipment
    - Player can wield, monster cannot (too complicated)
- repositories
- user-level configs for
    - keymaps
    - morgues
    - etc
- Map generation 
- Monster AI
