- Add other actors with random AI (right now am adding actors list to Level)
- Screens
- Github CI
- user-level configs for
    - keymaps
    - morgues
    - etc
- Map generation 
- Monster AI
- Separate client from game, communicate over event queue
- Consider typedeffing 'subsets' of Obj like `type Actor Obj` so we can catch
  cases where an Item is being assigned to an occupant slot or something like
  that, and can reduce # of traits being passed into the obj constructor as nil.
