NEXT:
- Create custom chasing for territorial monster that stops as soon as out of LOS

- Monster AI:
    Types:
        - Wandering
            x Wander (select point, walk towards it, wait a bit, select new one.)
              into
            x Detect & Chase
            - Detection should be based on monster LOS in personality
        - Territorial 
            - Sit still
            - Chase when detected; return home when lose detection 
        - Lazy
            - Sit still
            - Chase when attacked
            - Stay at last position when lose detection
    - Should have 'sensors' (can detect by scent) or 'seers' (can only detect in LOS but chases by scent)
 
Then:
- Monsters drop loot
- Add a basic "you got to level 5 you win"
- Egos (?), artefacts.
- Consumables can have duration effects.

Stuff:
- Consumables stack in inventories.
- Monster pack starting formation and proper pack placement.
- XP spending on skills
- user-level configs for
    - keymaps
    - morgues
    - etc
- Pack AI
- Room variations ("vaults")
- Room decorations
- regen SP

Bugs:

HAX:
- items aren't really using gameobj? They never get placed on a tile, just in an inventory in a tile. They could probably just be their own thing, and make *obj into *actor???
- Actor would have everything it has now
- Item would have Game, Level, (no tile), only have item traits, actor would only have actor traits
- OK, different idea -- maybe "placed on a map" is just merged into Mover, and you always go through Mover to get the tile. Then move Pos and all that crap over to Mover.
