NEXT:

- Monster Ranged weapons
    - MonsterSheet needs ranged []Attack
    - Monster AI needs to be adjusted for monsters with ranged attacks.
    - "Archer" AI
- Weapon procs
    - weapons can have an effect at the end? (e.g. rockets, quakehammers)

- "Remember" last target between shots.

- Monsters have multiple abilities.
    - Abilities need:
        - cooldown
        - function that implements behaviour
        - a predicate that says whether they're applicable or not. (?)
        - Ability to affect transitions on AI. (i.e. if a thief steals
          something, it should flee and not stop until it's dead)
    - Monsters need:
        - Collection of abilities with their probability of using it
        - Do angband-ish thing? One in X chance of using an ability, then
          %chance of each. If no ability available, then move/attack as normal.

- Monster AI:
    Types:
        x Wandering
            x Wander (select point, walk towards it, wait a bit, select new one.)
              into
            x Detect & Chase
            x Detection should be based on monster LOS in personality
        x Territorial 
            x Sit still
            x Chase when detected; return home when lose detection 
        - Lazy
            - Sit still
            - Chase when attacked
            - Stay at last position when lose detection
 
Then:
- Open/close doors
- Add a basic "you got to level 5 you win"
- Unique items, monsters in gen.c
- Monster capabilities: Can/can't open doors.
- Equipment needs to be able to modify all skills, stats, etc.
- Mores
  - Game should emit important events so that user prefs can decide to more
    on them or not.
  - e.g. GameOverEvent should trigger a more.
  - Multiple more-triggering events generated after a single user turn should
    just generate a single more.
  - The hud should process messages before processing events. (How? Events are done externally.)
  - Mores (for paging purposes) and "force mores" (warning!!!) should be
    separate ideas. 


Stuff:
- Consumables stack in inventories.
- Monster pack starting formation and proper pack placement.
- user-level configs for
    - keymaps
    - morgues
    - etc
- Pack AI
- Room variations ("vaults")
- Room decorations
- regen SP
- provide an option to get "attack breakdown" on every hit e.g. damage from any
  brands, damage resisted
- markup language in Message that can be used to suggest colors in client.

Bug:
- If you equip a weapon that grants +ev, you see 0-0 in prot display if you're not wearing armor.

Cleanup:
- Revisit and clean up skills panel
- Great Visibility Sweep -- exporting types and fields has been done really
  haphazardly, and signals the wrong things. Should be cleaned up.
- Need a "read-only" game interface or something that the client can pull from
  when it needs information, instead of having access to the whole game. Maybe
  a distilled gamestate, which represents what we'll need to send over wire to
  the web client anyways.
