NEXT:
- Finish non-ability melee combat, with mob death and proper stats display.

Then:
- Basic consumables.
- Level generation. 
    - Monster generation
    - Item generation
    - Map generation
- Monsters drop loot
- Monsters have tracking / movement+attacking AI. 
- Add stairs / progression.
- Add a basic "you got to level 5 you win"
- Egos (?), artefacts.

Stuff:
- Equipment
    x inventory on ground and for actors
    x Picking up off ground (just the top)
    x showing what's in inventory
    s pickup up off ground (select what you want)
        x pick from menu
        x we really need commands to also be structs. keymaps be damned.
    x Inv has capacity
    x Write tests for this stuff ^
    x wielding or wearing what's in inventory
        - Weapons need a way to:
            x Describe their weight, damage dice, tohit.
            x Identify what equipment slot they should go in
            x Items need a trait "Equip"
    - hit with weapons
    - protect with armor
    - Monsters should have same bodytype, fighting setup as player in first version. 
- Monster fighting:
    - Monsters get a list of attacks w/ probs, with heft and dice, melee
    - Also get a single armor slot
    - Maybe MonsterSheet and PlayerSheet should not share interface, and
      instead the monsterfighter defers to monstersheet to get what it
      needs. But since both the AI and Fighter probably need it, it
      shouldn't be owned by either.
- Actors can die
- Items / consumables
    - 
- XP spending on skills
- Stairs and level progression
- user-level configs for
    - keymaps
    - morgues
    - etc
- Map generation 
- Monster AI

HAX:
- items aren't really using gameobj? They never get placed on a tile, just in an inventory in a tile. They could probably just be their own thing, and make *obj into *actor???
- Actor would have everything it has now
- Item would have Game, Level, (no tile), only have item traits, actor would only have actor traits
- OK, different idea -- maybe "placed on a map" is just merged into Mover, and you always go through Mover to get the tile. Then move Pos and all that crap over to Mover.
