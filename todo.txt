- Generalize "player on map" to "actor on map" somehow :/
- Make Point comparable??? Then use this to do points bounds checking?
tests:
    - New shape stuff (In, Contains)
    - Actor move (once moveable -> component)

- user-level configs for
    - keymaps
    - morgues
    - etc
- Add other actors with random AI
- Map generation 
- Monster AI
- Screens
- Separate client from game, communicate over event queue
